I joined the Department of Artificial Intelligence at the [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) in March 2022. 
Since November 2023, I have been assisting with the research project on campus lecture scheduling through real-time tracking of carbon footprint for net-zero classes at the [Data Science Research Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/). 
If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me via email.
