I entered the AI Department at [Dong-A University](https://english.donga.ac.kr/sites/english/index.do) in March 2022. It has been active since November 2023. [Data Science Lab](https://www.datasciencelabs.org/) is focusing on research on location selection methodology using data mining and graph networks.
